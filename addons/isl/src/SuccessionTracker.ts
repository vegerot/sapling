/**
 * When a commit is amended or rebased or otherwise modified, the old commit
 * is marked obsolete and "succeeded" by a new commit.
 * Some state in the UI is keyed by hash, so a succession event can cause the UI
 * to show stale data. For example, if you select a commit and amend a commit earlier in the stack,
 * your selection will now disappear.
 *
 * To avoid this, we keep track of commits being succeeded, and any recoil state keyed on hashes
 * can listen to this event and update itself with the new oldHash -> newHash.
 *
 * Succession is tracked by looking at each new batch of commits we get, each of which may have
 * a closestPredecessors field. Technically, it's probably possible that a commit is succeeded twice
 * between results from `sl log`, which would cause us to miss a succession. We'll ignore this case for now,
 * and assume it's rare.
 *
 * Note that successions could also be detected on the server by stdout or other means from sl,
 * but by doing it on the client we know that all successions are dealt with at the exact moment the
 * UI state gets a new list of commits, reducing any race between succession events and new commits rendering.
