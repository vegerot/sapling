## 0.1.29

### Oct 26 2023

- Add initial support for special handling for generated files
  - Currently checks for "&#0064;generated" in the head of any files
  - Eventually this will also be configurable by path to look for commons files
  - Generated files are sorted below regular files in the list of uncommitted changes,
    and the section is collapsed by default
  - Generated files' content is hidden by default in the comparison view
  - Also supports _partially generated_ files by looking for "&#0064;partially-generated". These files are marked as generated, but not collapsed.
- Improve how obsolete commits behave with operations. If a commit is already obsolete (has a newer version from some operation, such as amending), operations will act on it specifically, instead of using the latest successor. This makes drag-and-drop rebase more predicatable when dragging onto commits which are obsolete and fixes some weird behaviors.
- Add options to goto, rebase to same public base, and rebase on top when downloading (pulling) commits
- Remember UI layout (commit info sidebar expansion/width) when reopening the page

- Improvements to file chunk selection UX
- Fix discarding subsets of files not actually deleting them from disk

  We expect this feature to change in the next few releases.
- Now in beta: _Partial "Chunk" Selection_ of uncommitted changes.
