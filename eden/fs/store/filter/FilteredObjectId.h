/**
 * FilteredBackingStores need to keep track of a few extra pieces of state with
 * each ObjectId in order to properly filter objects across their lifetime.
 *
 * The first crucial piece of information they need is whether the given object
 * is a tree, blob, or unfiltered object. This is defined in the first byte of
 * the ObjectId (see FilteredObjectIdType above). The rest of the
 * FilteredObjectId (FOID for short) is different depending on the object's type
 * (tree, blob, or unfiltered).
 *
 * ============= Blob FOIDs =============
 *
 * By filtering trees directly, we get blob filtering for free! This is because
 * we process (and filter) the direct children of a tree whenever we process a
 * tree itself. Any filtered blobs are unreachable after their parent tree is
 * processed.
 *
 * This means Blob FOIDs don't need any extra information associated with them
 * besides the type byte mentioned above. Our Blob FOIDs are in the form:
 *
 * <foid_type_byte><ObjectId>
 *
 * The ObjectId mentioned above can be used in whatever BackingStore the
 * FilteredBackingStore is wrapped around. In most cases, this will be an
 * HgObjectID.
 *
 * ============= Tree FOIDs =============
 *
 * For trees, we need to keep track of what filter was active when the ObjectId
 * was created when the corresponding tree was fetched. This information is
 * variable length, so we use a VarInt to encode the length of the filter id.
 *
 * We also need to keep track of the path associated with the tree object so we
 * can determine whether the object needs to be filtered prior to fetching any
 * data associated with it. The path is variable length, so we use a VarInt to
 * encode the length of the path.
 *
 * Finally, like blobs, we include an ObjectId we can use in the BackingStore
 * the FilteredBackingStore wraps. ObjectIds are variable length, but we place
 * them at the end of the ObjectID. Therefore we should always know where they
 * end. This gives us the form:
 *
 * <foid_type_byte><VarInt><filter_set_id><varint><path><ObjectId>
 *
 * ========= Unfiltered Tree FOIDs =========
 *
 * To optimize the common case of not having to filter a tree or its
 * descendents, we also have a special type for unfiltered TREE objects. This
 * type is the exact same as a Blob FOID, except it has a different type byte.
 *
 * <foid_type_byte><ObjectId>
 *
 * Differentiating between partially-filtered vs recursively-unfiltered trees
 * allows us to avoid recursive descendent checks in checkout/diff when filter
 * changes occur in unrelated parts of the repository.
