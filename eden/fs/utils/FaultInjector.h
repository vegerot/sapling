/**
 * A helper class for injecting artificial faults into the normal program flow.
 *
 * This allows external test code to inject delay or failures into specific
 * locations in the program.
 *
 * To use this class, add calls to FaultInjector::check() in your code anywhere
 * that you would like to be able to inject faults during testing.  During
 * normal production use these calls do nothing, and immediately return.
 * However, during tests this allows faults to be injected, causing any call to
 * FaultInjector::check() to potentially throw an exception, trigger a delay, or
 * wait until it is explicitly unblocked.  This allows exercising error handling
 * code that is otherwise difficult to trigger reliably.  This also allows
 * forcing specific ordering of events, in order to ensure that you can test
 * specific code paths.

   * runtime overhead.  If `enabled` is true then fault injector checks are
   * evaluated, allowing exceptions or delays to be injected into the code at
   * any check.
   *
   * The normal expected use is for most programs to have a single FaultInjector
   * object, with the `enabled` setting controlled via a command line flag or
   * some other configuration read at program start-up.  During normal
   * production use `enabled` is false, allowing all fault checks to be quickly
   * skipped with minimal overhead.  During unit tests and integration tests the
   * `enabled` flag can be turned on, allowing faults to be injected in the code

   *
   * If fault injection is disabled or if there is no matching fault for this
   * (keyClass, keyValue) tuple, then this function returns immediately without
   * doing anything.
   *
   * However, if fault injection is enabled and a fault has been injected
   * matching the arguments this method may throw an exception or block for some
   * amount of time before returning (or throwing).
   *
   * Faults are identified by a (class, value) tuple.  In practice, the class
   * name is usually a fixed string literal that identifies the type of fault or
   * the location in the code where the fault is being checked.  The value
   * string may contain some additional runtime-specified value to filter the
   * fault to only trigger when this code path is hit with specific arguments.
   *
   * keyValues may consist of a single std::string_view which will be passed
   * directly to checkImpl.  If keyValues is multiple arguments or of another
   * type, the arguments will be converted to strings using fmt and joined with
   * ", " as the delimiter.  E.g., calling check("myFault", "foo", "bar") will
   * use "foo, bar" as the key.

   * This string construction is only done if fault injection is enabled,
   * and so has no extra overhead if fault injection is disabled.
