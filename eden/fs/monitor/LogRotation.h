/**
 * Basic API for implementing various log rotation strategies.
 *
 * Log rotation is performed in two stages:
 * - In the main thread, we first rename the existing log file to a new name,
 *   then open the log path again to create a new log file.  This should ideally
 *   be a relatively fast operation, and allow the main thread to quickly resume
 *   log forwarding.  The rest of the rotation work is then performed in a
 *   separate background thread.
 *
 * - After the main thread renames the log file, a background thread is then
 *   invoked to perform all additional rotation work.  This could involve
 *   further renaming the log file, renaming and/or deleting older log files,
 *   compressing the log file, etc.
