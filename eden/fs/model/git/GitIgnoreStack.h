/**
 * GitIgnoreStack represents a stack of GitIgnore files, one per directory
 * level.
 *
 * This provides an API for checking the ignore status of paths inside a
 * directory.  The path name will be checked against the ignore rules found in
 * its directory, and if no match is found, the ignore rules from its parent
 * directory, and so on all the way up to the root.
 *
 * Several notes about usage:
 * - GitIgnoreStack objects are really just nodes in the stack.  They contain a
 *   pointer to their parent GitIgnoreStack node.
 *
 * - GitIgnoreStack objects refer to their parent with a raw pointer, and rely
 *   on the user to ensure that parent GitIgnoreStack objects always exist for
 *   longer than children GitIgnoreStacks that refer to them.  (We could have
 *   used a shared_ptr to ensure that parents exist for as long as the
 *   children, but in practice state for the parent directory always outlives
 *   state for the children directories anyway, so there is no real need to
 *   track ownership inside GitIgnoreStack using shared_ptr refcounts.)
 *
 * - You must create a GitIgnoreStack object for each directory, even if that
 *   directory does not contain a .gitignore file.  gitignore rules are always
 *   relative to the directory that contains the .gitignore file.  We use the
 *   number of levels in the GitIgnoreStack to figure out which part of the
 *   path the rules apply to.
