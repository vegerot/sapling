/**
 * A fake directory entry for use inside VirtualInode.
 *
 * The VirtualInode class allows callers to see a "mixed" view of the eden
 * mount, which respresents both on-disk (inode) state, and in-backing-store
 * (source control) state. When a DirEntry represents a ObjectStore object that
 * doesn't exist on disk (isn't loaded, isn't materialized), some of the
 * contents of DirEntry must be returned to represent the object (particularly
 * the ObjectId), but DirEntry can't be safely copied, as it protected by the
 * holding-Inode's contents() lock.
 *
 * This class copies enough of the DirEntry to be able to reason about the
 * underlying objects, and is safe to copy around.
