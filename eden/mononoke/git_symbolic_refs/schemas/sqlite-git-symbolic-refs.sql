-- Table for maintaining list of symbolic refs (symref) for a repo.
-- Symbolic refs are different from regular refs (branches and tags) and hence are not
-- stored in the bookmarks table. Instead of pointing to a commit, symbolic refs point
-- to another ref within the repository. HEAD is an example of a symref
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `git_symbolic_refs` (
  `repo_id` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, -- The ID of the repo for which this symref exists
  `symref_name` VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL, -- The name of the symref
  `ref_name` VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL, -- The name of the ref that is pointed to by the symref
  `ref_type` VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL DEFAULT (CAST('branch' AS BLOB)), -- The type of the ref, only acceptable values are 'branch' and 'tag'
  PRIMARY KEY (`repo_id`, `symref_name`)
