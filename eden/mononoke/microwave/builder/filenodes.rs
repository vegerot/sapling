        // reporting filenodes as derived later, then we'll have missing filenodes in the DB).
        //
        // - Proxying the write to the `inner` implementation should in theory work, but that could
        // break things if we release a new binary that writes the wrong thing (e.g. like the issue
        // we historically had with writing to and reading from the wrong shard for filenodes). It
