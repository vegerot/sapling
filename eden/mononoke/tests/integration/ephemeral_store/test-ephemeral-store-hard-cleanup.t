Cleanup expired bubbles in dry-run mode:
  $ mononoke_admin ephemeral-store -R repo cleanup -n -c 0
  Fetched 4 expired bubbles for deletion
  Executing cleanup in dry-run mode. The following bubbles were fetched for deletion:
  [BubbleId(1), BubbleId(2), BubbleId(3), BubbleId(4)]

Cleanup expired bubbles with too high cut-off
  $ mononoke_admin ephemeral-store -R repo cleanup -n -c 100000
  No expired bubbles found for deletion based on input provided

Cleanup expired bubbles with zero as the limit
  $ mononoke_admin ephemeral-store -R repo cleanup -l 0
  No expired bubbles found for deletion based on input provided

Cleanup expired bubbles in dry-run mode with non-zero as the limit
  $ mononoke_admin ephemeral-store -R repo cleanup -l 2 -n -c 0
  Fetched 2 expired bubbles for deletion
  Executing cleanup in dry-run mode. The following bubbles were fetched for deletion:
  [BubbleId(1), BubbleId(2)]

Before doing actual clean-up, verify that the blob indeed exists

  Blob still present

Cleanup expired bubbles with no cut-off

  Cleaned up bubble 1 and deleted 7 blob keys contained in it
  Cleaned up bubble 2 and deleted 13 blob keys contained in it
  Cleaned up bubble 3 and deleted 19 blob keys contained in it
  Cleaned up bubble 4 and deleted 43 blob keys contained in it

# need to be actually deleted.
Verify the blob keys are indeed deleted (using a key from Bubble 1). Below query should NOT return the matching blob.
