Cleanup expired bubbles in dry-run mode:
  $ mononoke_newadmin ephemeral-store -R repo cleanup -n -c 0
  Fetched 4 expired bubbles for deletion
  Executing cleanup in dry-run mode. The following bubbles were fetched for deletion:
  [BubbleId(1), BubbleId(2), BubbleId(3), BubbleId(4)]

Cleanup expired bubbles with too high cut-off
  $ mononoke_newadmin ephemeral-store -R repo cleanup -n -c 100000
  No expired bubbles found for deletion based on input provided

Cleanup expired bubbles with zero as the limit
  $ mononoke_newadmin ephemeral-store -R repo cleanup -l 0
  No expired bubbles found for deletion based on input provided

Cleanup expired bubbles in dry-run mode with non-zero as the limit
  $ mononoke_newadmin ephemeral-store -R repo cleanup -l 2 -n -c 0
  Fetched 2 expired bubbles for deletion
  Executing cleanup in dry-run mode. The following bubbles were fetched for deletion:
  [BubbleId(1), BubbleId(2)]

Before doing actual clean-up, verify that the blob indeed exists

Cleanup expired bubbles with no cut-off
