# may be either 35 (CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR) or 56 (CURLE_RECV_ERROR).
# Sometimes we might get 55 (CURLE_SEND_ERROR) when server closes connection
# very quickly and curl still attempts to send data because it does not assume
# mTLS connection, but it fails to do so. Whether curl is quick enough to make
# the initial GET request depends whether the exit code will be 55 or 56.
