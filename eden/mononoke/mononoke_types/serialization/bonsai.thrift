// Parent ordering
// ---------------
// "Ordered" parents means that behavior will change if the order of parents
// changes.
// Whether parents are ordered varies by source control system.
// * In Mercurial, parents are stored ordered and the UI is order-dependent,
//   but are hashed unordered.
// * In Git, parents are stored and hashed ordered and the UI is also order-
//   dependent.
// These data structures will store parents in ordered form, as presented by
// Mercurial. This does hypothetically mean that a single Mercurial changeset
// can map to two Mononoke changesets -- those cases are extremely unlikely
// in practice, and if they're deliberately constructed Mononoke will probably
// end up rejecting whatever comes later.

// Other notes:
// * This uses sorted sets and maps to ensure deterministic
//   serialization.
// * Added and modified files are both part of file_changes.
// * file_changes is at the end of the struct so that a deserializer that just
//   wants to read metadata can stop early.
// * NonRootMPath, Id and DateTime fields do not have a reasonable default value, so
//   they must always be either "required" or "optional".
// * The set of keys in file_changes is path-conflict-free (pcf): no changed
//   path is a directory prefix of another path. So file_changes can never have
//   "foo" and "foo/bar" together, but "foo" and "foo1" are OK.
//   * If a directory is replaced by a file, the bonsai changeset will only
//     record the file being added. The directory being deleted is implicit.
//   * This only applies if the potential prefix is changed. Deleted files can
//     have conflicting subdirectory entries recorded for them.
//   * Corollary: The file list in Mercurial is not pcf, so the Bonsai diff is
//     computed separately.
