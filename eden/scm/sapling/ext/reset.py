    The reset command is for moving your active bookmark and working copy to a
    different location. This is useful for undoing commits, amends, etc.

    By default, the working copy content is not touched, so you will have
    pending changes after the reset. If --clean/-C is specified, the working
    copy contents will be overwritten to match the destination revision, and you
    will not have any pending changes.

    After your bookmark and working copy have been moved, the command will
    delete any changesets that belonged only to that bookmark. Use --keep/-k to
    avoid deleting any changesets.
