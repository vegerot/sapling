def unamend(ui, repo, **opts):
    """undo the last amend operation on the current commit

    Reverse the effects of an :prog:`amend` operation. Hides the current commit
    and checks out the previous version of the commit. :prog:`unamend` does not
    revert the state of the working copy, so changes that were added to the
    commit in the last amend operation become pending changes in the working
    copy.

    :prog:`unamend` cannot be run on amended commits that have children. In
    other words, you cannot unamend an amended commit in the middle of a
    stack.

    .. note::

        Running :prog:`unamend` is similar to running :prog:`undo --keep`
        immediately after :prog:`amend`. However, unlike :prog:`undo`, which can
        only undo an amend if it was the last operation you performed,
        :prog:`unamend` can unamend any draft amended commit in the graph that
        does not have children.

    .. container:: verbose

      Although :prog:`unamend` is typically used to reverse the effects of
      :prog:`amend`, it actually rolls back the current commit to its previous
      version, regardless of whether the changes resulted from an :prog:`amend`
      operation or from another operation, such as :prog:`rebase`.
