    Upstream copytracing function returns five dicts:
    "copy", "movewithdir", "diverge", "renamedelete" and "dirmove". See below
    for a more detailed description (mostly copied from upstream).
    This extension returns "copy" dict only, everything else is empty.

    "copy" is a mapping from destination name -> source name,
    where source is in csrc and destination is in cdst or vice-versa.

    "movewithdir" is a mapping from source name -> destination name,
    where the file at source present in one context but not the other
    needs to be moved to destination by the merge process, because the
    other context moved the directory it is in.

    "diverge" is a mapping of source name -> list of destination names
    for divergent renames. On the time of writing this extension it was used
    only to print warning.

    "renamedelete" is a mapping of source name -> list of destination
    names for files deleted in c1 that were renamed in c2 or vice-versa.
    On the time of writing this extension it was used only to print warning.

    "dirmove" is a mapping of detected source dir -> destination dir renames.
    This is needed for handling changes to new files previously grafted into
    renamed directories.
