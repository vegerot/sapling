Function to test discovery between two repos in both directions, using both the local shortcut
(which is currently not activated by default) and the full remotable protocol:

  $ testdesc() { # revs_a, revs_b, dagdesc
  >     if [ -d foo ]; then rm -rf foo; fi
  >     hg init foo
  >     cd foo
  >     hg debugbuilddag "$3"

Set iteration order could cause wrong and unstable results - fixed in 73cfaa348650:

The case where all the 'initialsamplesize' samples already were common would
give 'all remote heads known locally' without checking the remaining heads -
fixed in 86c35b7ae300:
