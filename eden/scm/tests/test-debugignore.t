Works with sparse checkouts as well.
  $ newrepo
  $ enable sparse
  $ hg sparse include b
  $ touch a b c
  $ cat > .gitignore << EOF
  > a
  > EOF
  $ hg debugignore a
  a: ignored by rule a from .gitignore
  
  $ hg debugignore b
  b: not ignored
  $ hg debugignore c
  c is not in sparse profile
