Quote from test-revert.t but this version is stronger - mtime was changed
manually.

Initially, dirstate does not have mtime set for files if the command was
executed quickly (mtime == fsnow at the end of the command).

#  $ hg debugdirstate
#  n 644          1 unset               A
#  n 644          1 unset               B

Calling hg status would update mtimes in dirstate (unless mtime == now)

  $ touch -t 200001010000 A B
  $ hg status
  $ hg debugdirstate
  n 644          1 2000-01-01 00:00:00 A
  n 644          1 2000-01-01 00:00:00 B

Revert "A" so its content will change. The size does not change and we set
mtime to make it unchanged.

  $ hg revert -r $A A
  $ touch -t 200001010000 A

dirstate mtime for "A" is changed to "unset"

  $ hg debugdirstate
  n   0         -1 unset               A
  n 644          1 2000-01-01 00:00:00 B

status can detect "A" is modified

  $ hg status
  M A
