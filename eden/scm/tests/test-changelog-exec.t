b51a8138292a introduced a regression where we would mention in the
changelog executable files added by the second parent of a merge. Test
that that doesn't happen anymore


  $ hg init repo
  $ cd repo
  $ echo foo > foo
  $ hg ci -qAm 'add foo'

  $ echo bar > bar
  $ chmod +x bar
  $ hg ci -qAm 'add bar'

manifest of p2:

  $ hg manifest
  bar
  foo

  $ hg up -qC bbd179dfa0a71671c253b3ae0aa1513b60d199fa
  $ echo >> foo
  $ hg ci -m 'change foo'

manifest of p1:

  $ hg manifest
  foo

  $ hg merge
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  (branch merge, don't forget to commit)
  $ chmod +x foo
  $ hg ci -m 'merge'

this should not mention bar but should mention foo:
