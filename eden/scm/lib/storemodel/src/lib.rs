//! # storemodel
//!
//! Provides trait definitions for storage needs.
//! Useful to de-couple from heavyweight storage implementations.
//!
//! Traits defined by this crate are ideally tech-debt free and
//! consider both hg and git use-cases. This mainly means:
//! - APIs do expose hg details like filelog "copy from" or LFS pointer.
//! - History-related APIs should avoid linkrev or linknode, which do not exist
//!   in git.
//!
//! For flexibility, different features might be defined in different traits.
//! Traits can be combined later. For example, reading file content, metadata,
//! and history should probably be 3 different traits.
