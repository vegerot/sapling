//! NDJSON (new line delimited json) IPC over a duplex file descriptor
//! that is compatible with nodejs child process IPC.
//!
//! Note this library is meant to be simple and intentionally avoids complex
//! parts of the nodejs IPC, including:
//! - The "advanced" serialization [1]. It is implemented in V8's C++ code
//!   and does not have a Rust equivalent.
//! - The ability to send file descriptor around. This is complicated [2]
//!   and not yet interesting for Sapling's use-cases.
