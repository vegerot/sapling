//! Create tracing Callsites dynamically.
//!
//! The Rust tracing crate provides macros to define Callsite and FieldSet
//! as static global variables. That serves Rust's usecases well but is
//! problematic for Python's use-cases where there are no `'static`.
//!
//! This crate is to fill the gap so Python (or other dynamic language) can
//! register Callsites on the fly to satisfy tracing's interface.
