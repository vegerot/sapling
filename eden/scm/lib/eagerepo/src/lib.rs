//! Provides a non-lazy repo that serves as a "server" repo in tests.
//!
//! Main goals:
//! - Pure Rust. No Python dependencies.
//! - Serve as SaplingRemoteApi without going through real networking stack.
//! - Replace SSH reps in tests, which is slow and unreliable on Windows.
//!
//! Although it's currently intended to be a test server repo. It is
//! in theory not too difficult to make it useful as a kind of small
//! client repo.
//!
//! [`EagerRepo`] is the main struct.
//!
//! The word "eager" comes from "eager evaluation", the opposite of
//! "lazy evaluation".
