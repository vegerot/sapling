        # a series of writes, then mmap of that file with a size larger than the
        # file (but still within the trailing page) does not zero the trailing
        # bytes.  Clang relies on this mmap behavior to enforce that the buffer
        # is null-terminated.  Since the buffer ends up not being null-
        # terminated, Clang segfaults.
